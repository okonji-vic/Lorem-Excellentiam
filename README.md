### State Management
- **ProjectContext**: Manages projects, tasks, milestones, and team members
- **ThemeContext**: Handles dark/light theme switching
- Local state for component-specific data

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Context API over Redux**: Chosen for simplicity and built-in React integration
2. **CSS Modules**: Provides scoped styling and better maintainability
3. **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience
4. **Component Composition**: Highly reusable and modular components
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with CSS Grid and Flexbox

## üë• User Roles

### Developer View
- Kanban-style task board
- Task creation and status updates
- Time tracking and filtering
- Personal productivity metrics

### Project Manager View
- Project overview cards
- Milestone tracking
- Team resource allocation
- Risk assessment and deadline monitoring

### Executive View
- High-level KPIs and metrics
- Budget utilization tracking
- Project status distribution
- Strategic performance indicators

## üé® Design System

### Color Palette
- Primary: #0078d4 (Microsoft Blue)
- Success: #107c10
- Warning: #ff8c00
- Error: #d13438
- Neutral grays for backgrounds and borders

### Typography
- Font Family: System font stack with fallbacks
- Responsive font sizing
- Consistent weight hierarchy

### Animations
- Fade-in animations for page transitions
- Slide-up animations for cards
- Scale animations for interactive elements
- Smooth hover transitions

## üîß AI Prompts Used

### Successful Prompts:

1. **"Create a comprehensive project delivery dashboard with role-based views for developers, PMs, and executives using React, TypeScript, and CSS modules"**
   - Generated the initial project structure and component hierarchy

2. **"Design a responsive Kanban board component for task management with drag-and-drop functionality and filtering"**
   - Created the developer view with task cards and filtering system

3. **"Build an executive dashboard with KPI cards, charts, and budget tracking using modern CSS animations"**
   - Generated the executive view with metrics and data visualization

4. **"Create a theme system with CSS variables supporting dark and light modes with smooth transitions"**
   - Implemented the theming system with persistent storage

5. **"Design a comprehensive form system for adding projects and tasks with validation and responsive layout"**
   - Built the form components with proper validation

### Failed Prompt:

**"Generate a real-time WebSocket connection for live project updates with automatic synchronization"**

**Why it failed**: This prompt was too complex for a frontend-only assessment and would require backend infrastructure. The scope was beyond the static data simulation requirement, and implementing WebSocket connections would have added unnecessary complexity to the assessment focus areas.

## ü§î Reflection Questions

### 1. How did you approach the state management architecture?

I chose React Context API over more complex solutions like Redux because:
- The application has moderate complexity that Context can handle efficiently
- It provides a clean separation of concerns with ProjectContext and ThemeContext
- No external dependencies required, keeping the bundle size smaller
- Easy to test and maintain

The state is structured hierarchically with projects containing milestones and tasks, allowing for efficient data relationships and updates.

### 2. What were your key design decisions for the UI/UX?

- **Role-based navigation**: Clear visual distinction between user roles with dedicated views
- **Progressive disclosure**: Information hierarchy that shows relevant details based on user needs
- **Consistent visual language**: Unified color system, typography, and spacing
- **Accessibility first**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML
- **Mobile-responsive**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptive layouts

### 3. How did you simulate dynamic behavior with static data?

- **In-memory state updates**: All CRUD operations update the Context state immediately
- **Calculated fields**: Progress percentages and metrics computed in real-time
- **Optimistic updates**: UI updates immediately before any "backend" simulation
- **Session persistence**: Changes persist during the browser session
- **Realistic data relationships**: Foreign keys and data integrity maintained

### 4. What would you improve with more time?

- **Advanced animations**: More sophisticated transitions and micro-interactions
- **Data persistence**: Local storage or IndexedDB for session persistence
- **Advanced filtering**: Multi-criteria filtering with search functionality
- **Drag-and-drop**: Kanban board with task reordering
- **Performance optimization**: Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests

### 5. How does this scale for larger teams/projects?

The current architecture supports scaling through:
- **Modular component structure**: Easy to add new views and features
- **Type-safe interfaces**: Prevents runtime errors as complexity grows
- **Context separation**: Different contexts can be optimized independently
- **CSS architecture**: Scoped modules prevent style conflicts

For enterprise scale, I would consider:
- State management migration to Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- Component library extraction for reusability
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Advanced caching strategies
